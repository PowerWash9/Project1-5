                        <p>I enjoy watching movies, especially around this time of the year. I enjoy watching
                            comedies, as well as thrillers. One of my favorite non-holiday movies are the
                            Rush Hour series. During Halloween, I enjoy watching horror movies with my family,
                            and we try to watch as many. Some movies include the Scream series, the Halloween 
                            series, and Friday the 13th. For the Christmas season, I watch Christmas movies,
                            such as Elf, Home Alone 1 and 2, Jingle All the Way, and How the Grinch Stole Christmas. 
                            I also watch these movies with family, and it is something I do not get tired of each year.</p>

                        <p>Even though my major is dealing with computes, I cannot seem to get tired
                        of being on a computer. However, I will take breaks to ensure I am not sitting around 
                        all day. When I have some free time, I will learn all that I can regarding computers, such 
                        as how the hardware operates, but I do not have much experience. I help my family whenever
                        they have an issue with their device, but I have not taken apart many devices. I hope to build my
                        own computer someday, but it may be a while. I am also learning the software side of computers. 
                        I am learning how to create programs and webpages in many computer languages. I enjoy coding, even
                        if there are times where I spend a little too long with a program. I am also learning how networking 
                        works. I have taken courses to learn all about it, as well as how to protect yourself from 
                        malicious attacks. Computers are advancing at a rapid rate, so I do all that I can to learn so I 
                        can help family and friends stay safe on the internet and keep their devices running smoothly.</p>

                        <p>Playing games with family and friends is another hobby of mine, and it is 
                        not limited to video games. It can be board games, or even games made up by 
                        one of my family members. It is enjoyable to play something and think of a way
                        to win, or just play and see what kind of answers we all can come up with. I 
                        would even play video games by myself whenever I want to relax. Especially 
                        when it rains, I enjoy staying in and either play games by myself, or with 
                        friends over the internet. I do not have any preference on the games to play,
                        as long as I have fun playing it.</p>

                        <p>All genres of music are enjoyable to me. Around the Christmas season, I listen 
                        to Christmas music almost all day. Like watching Halloween or Christmas movies, I 
                        do not seem to get tired of these as well. Not only do I like listening to music, but 
                        I like to play it as well. I am learning the piano, and although I am not very advanced 
                        at it yet, I enjoy playing the simple songs for the time being. I hope to get better at 
                        reading sheet music. I know the notes and can understand it, but being able to translate 
                        while playing at normal speed is not something I can do just yet. I would not mind learning 
                        other instrusments as well, but I think one instrument at a time is the way for me.</p>
